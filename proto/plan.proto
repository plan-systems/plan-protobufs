/******************************************************************************************************************************************
plan.Block is a fundamental PLAN data structure intended for generic content packaging and serialization. 
Its purpose is to be a flexible, extensible content container able to hold any number of sub containers, 
each containing content serialized in any form.

The principles behind Block were inspired from http, championed by Tim Berners-Lee and others in the 1990s. 
In http, "Content-Type" specifies a MIME type, a codec descriptor that specifies the binary format of content. 
In PLAN, every content blob (Block) has BOTH a label AND codec descriptor, allowing for more powerful use cases. 
Block.label tells clients HOW TO USE Block.content while Block.codec tells clients WHICH DATA HANDLER should be applied.

Examples:

    Block.label     Block.codec             Block.content
    -----------     -----------             -------------
    episode         audio/mp3               <mp3 data>
    episode         video/mpeg              <mpeg data>
